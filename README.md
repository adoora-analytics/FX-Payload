# FX Rate ETL Pipeline (Portfolio Learning Project)

An incrementally developed FX rates ETL pipeline built in Python as part of a data engineering learning portfolio.
The project focuses on core ETL fundamentals, clean project structure, and disciplined version control rather than one-off scripts. 
This repository reflects realistic pipeline evolution, with progress tracked through daily Git commits.
