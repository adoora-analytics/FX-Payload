# FX Rate ETL Pipeline (Portfolio Learning Project)

An incrementally developed FX rates ETL pipeline built in Python as part of a data engineering learning portfolio.
The project focuses on core ETL fundamentals, clean project structure, and disciplined version control rather than one-off scripts. 
This repository reflects realistic pipeline evolution, with progress tracked through daily Git commits.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate:
Designing a clear Extract - Transform - Load (ETL) pipeline
Working with real-world API data
Normalizing nested JSON into structured records
Separating concerns across pipeline stages
Using Git properly to track incremental progress
